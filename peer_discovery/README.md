# Peer Discovery & Membership Module

**SJSU CMPE 275 Enterprise Applications | Final Project**

This module implements the **Peer Discovery and Membership** component of the class's peer-to-peer distributed chat system. The service acts as the central control plane for room membership, securely coordinating state across all distributed peers in the network.

---

## How It Works

The core philosophy is **complex coordination hidden behind a small API**. The service is the single source of truth for:
- Who is currently in the room.
- Whether members are actively connected or suspected of being disconnected.
- Where members are in their join lifecycle (e.g., waiting for message history backfill).

A member goes through several states during their time in the room:
`JOINING` → `BACKFILLING` → `ACTIVE` → `LEAVING` → `LEFT`

The system is powered by an **Idempotent Event Machine** over a **Gossip Network**. If an active member fails to send heartbeats, they enter a `SUSPECTED` state (a grace period). If they recover in time by sending a heartbeat, they return to `ACTIVE` without disruption. If they do not recover before the grace period ends, they become `DISCONNECTED`.

## Setup & Running

**Requirements:** Python 3.11+ and `cryptography` library.

**Running a Node from CLI:**
```bash
# Launch a seed node
python -m peer_discovery.network --port 5000 --advertise 127.0.0.1:5000 --room my-room --name Seed

# Join the network
python -m peer_discovery.network --port 5001 --advertise 127.0.0.1:5001 --room my-room --bootstrap 127.0.0.1:5000 --name Node2
```

**Running the Tests:**
```bash
pytest peer_discovery/ -v
```

---

## The Network Layer

The `peer_discovery.network` package wraps the local `MembershipService` into a fully distributed P2P node (`DiscoveryNode`).

1. **Transport & Framing**: Thread-per-connection TCP server with strict 64KB framing and 30-second timeouts.
2. **Hybrid Cryptography**: All join payloads and snapshots are encrypted. A joining node provides an RSA-2048 public key, and the seed node encrypts the `SNAPSHOT_RESPONSE` using an ephemeral AES-256-GCM key wrapped by the RSA key.
3. **Gossip Protocol**: State mutations are broadcast across the network. Cyclical gossip is prevented using a 10,000-entry `seen_event_ids` LRU cache.
4. **Heartbeats**: The `HeartbeatManager` continuously pings known peers, feeding liveness data into the local `PresenceManager`.

## Local API Integration

The `MembershipService` facade provides local teams with an easy O(1) API.

```python
from membership_integration.service import MembershipService

# Optional: wrap with DiscoveryNode for P2P routing
service = MembershipService(room_id="my-room")

# 1. Join a member (accepts cryptographic context)
result = service.join_member(user_id="alice", display_name="Alice", public_key=b"...")

# 2. Get a fast read of current state
snapshot = service.get_membership_snapshot()

# 3. Subscribe to network events
handle = service.subscribe_membership_events(on_event)
```

## Core Guarantees

| Guarantee | Reality |
|---|---|
| Single Source of Truth | Yes — The `MembershipEventLog` acts as the unquestionable append-only ledger of state changes. |
| Cryptographic Security | Yes — Joins are validated with RSA, and snapshots are encrypted with AES-GCM. |
| Deterministic State | Yes — The `MembershipSnapshot` is a materialized view derived strictly by applying the event log in order. |
| Event Notifications | Yes — Subscribers are notified sequentially of valid membership transitions via `EventNotifier`. |
| Fast Local Reads | Yes — `get_membership_snapshot()` provides an O(1) in-memory lookup. |
| P2P Resilience | Yes — State is replicated via Gossip, and duplicate frames are safely ignored. |
